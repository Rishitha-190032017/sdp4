                    Self driving tractors by <b>JHON DEERE</b> this was invented by <b>Frank W. Andrew</b> With 20 years of research and development, John Deere's fully autonomous tractors are set to change the way food is grown around the world.It might seem absurd to think that a tractor and its equipment can be controlled by a computer in a field by punching a few data into a touchscreen device, but you're right. Minnesota farmer Doug Nimz is no stranger to self-guiding tractors. On his 2,000-acre corn and soybean farm, John Deere, few years ago, brought a completely new kind of machine. In addition to being able to steer itself, that tractor didn't even require a farmer to be in the cab of it.
<p>The completed tractor was presented to the rest of the world on 5th of January 2022</p>A driverless tractor is a form of autonomous technology. It is considered driverless because it operates without the presence of a human inside the tractor itself. Like

other unmanned ground vehicles, they are programmed to independently observe their position, decide speed and avoid obstacles such as people, animals or objects in the field, while performing their task. The various driverless tractors are split into full autonomous technology and supervised autonomy. The idea of the

driverless tractor appears as early as 1940, but has really come to fruition in the last few years. The tractors use GPS and other wireless technologies to farm land without the need of a driver. They operate simply with the aid of a supervisor monitoring the progress at a control station or with a manned tractor in lead. Current leading manufacturers are John Deere, Autonomous Tractor Corporation, Fendt and Case IH.<p>First working prototype of self-driving tractor was unveiled back in 2016</p>
<h1>BENEFITS OF SELF DRIVING TRACTORS</h1>
    <b>1)</b> Driverless tractors can be used to carry out labor intensive farming while allowing farmers to do other work.<br> 
    <b>2)</b> A big plus is that it can increase crop yields while reducing costs because the automated machines can harvest 24/7.<br> 
    <b>3)</b> It can work in all weather conditions, and can minimize worker's fatigue.<br>
    <b>4)</b> By using this technology,the farmers can work for many hours without taking any kind of stress.<br>
    The sensors of the tractors will be able to collect the data regarding the conditions of soil,the maintenance of the crops which are already planted.It can also get all the data regarding the harvest before and after the cultivation.<br>
    <b>5)</b> The farmers will also get protection from the health hazards which occur while spraying the chemical fertilizers as that part of the work would be done by the driveless tractors without any sort of help from the humans.<br>
    <b>6)</b> These can also make sure that there is a very good quality in terms of the operations in farming and it is going to lead the farm in such a way that the productivity boosts which in turn leads to excellent yield.<br>
    <b>7)</b> The driveless tractors will do the planting automatically with very good accuracy which results in the conservation of seeds.This would slowly increase the returns of the farm leading the farmers to profits.<br>
